# Quest 3 - Data Engineering Project

Welcome to the Quest 3 Data Engineering project repository. This repository contains both the server and client components of our data engineering application.

## Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) must be installed on your system.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/isnardynicolas/quest-3.git

2. Navigate to the cloned repository:
   
cd quest-3

3. Launch the Docker containers for the application in development mode using Docker Compose:

docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build

4. You can access the React front-end of the application in your web browser at http://localhost:8080.
5. To make changes to the source code of the application, open the "client" directory on your machine, make the necessary modifications, and they will be automatically reflected in the application (hot reload).
6. To stop the development application, use Ctrl + C in your terminal to stop Docker Compose.

Happy coding!
